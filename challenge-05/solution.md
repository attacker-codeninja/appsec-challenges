# My Solution

My remediation guidance follows the OWASP XXE Cheat Sheet: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html. Check it out for concrete code samples.

How I would approach it:

- Clarify with the developers if they need doctypes at all

- If they don't, recommend that they disable doctypes entirely

- If they do, they should disable external entities and external doctypes

On top of this, there are some more flags which are recommended:

1. Explicitly disable XIncludes

2. Disable expansion for entity references

3Ô∏è. Enable Secure Processing
