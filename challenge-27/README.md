# Challenge Description

The goal of this challenge is to make the shopping system owe you money. Afterwards, provide concrete code-level remediation guidance for the vulnerability in the code. 

So this one's different: It's not a web app, but a small command-line app written in C. ðŸ˜ƒ 

This challenge highlights an attack class that, while somewhat legacy, is still commonly found and often leads to critical vulnerabilities..

You can run the challenge on your machine by compiling the code via `gcc -o main main.c`, and running the compiled binary: `./main`.
